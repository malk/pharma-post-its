* VD
** young ideas
*** Centralize ALL the logs
* 
* Domain
** Specialit√© Vs Presentation
* Tech details here and there
** We use "Velocity" templates for our GUIs
** Hoptimal creates some private versions of public APIs that are just atomToJson translations with a connection token
** 
* Varnish
** we shoudl not cache
*** walls that write
*** session toekns
*** user data
*** stat images
** 
* The table ronde Kanban
** is push-based and not pull-based
*** because we have uncontrolled workflow points
**** we should externalize those (while showing them) and pull between controlled ones
***** In the original kanban system: how does a kanban token migrates between boards?
** We have many boards
*** how to better relate them?
** We have many "done"
*** Which workflow points do they really represent?
**** is po done, real done and test wip really workflow points at all or just stock?
** we show suppositions of other teams workflow on it
*** we should not, we cant control that
** The multiple priority scheme (bottom up and then left o right and then color) is too complex
*** How can we unify the priority system?
** Why do we separate and prioritize by versions at all?
*** maybe we would fare better by just marking versions on the ticket itself?
**** maybe wed better not mark at all?
*** This show a want to show the release cycle on the kanban
**** also showing what versions have bugs
***** and which are under tests
****** Can we show all that in another way?
******* or elsewhere?
** why not a whole column for blocked tasks? do they remain in WIP if blocked?
** Do we want Jira to mirror our workflow someday?
